Enterprise Architecture Management Descriptoren unit component package


# Welcome to the EAMD.ucp wiki!

[Digital Leaders Initiative](http://digitalleadersinitiative.org/) presents:
The final lever to make anything a component.

Enterprise Architecture Management Descriptors for unit components and packages.

## What is a Unit

The world is full of Units. Every-thing is a Unit, but not every-thing is a Component.
Things can even be Units, composed of other Units.

## What is a Component?

But to ba a Component a unit has to fulfill 4 dedicated criteria:
* it's a black box
* it's fully selfcontained
* it has an interface
* it is self describing

Most things lack at least one criteria and therfore are not Components but units only.
The most often criteria units miss is: the self description.

Worldwide diffrent component types have been establisherd as successful prooven standards:
e.g. CCM, EJBs, OSGi, SCA
With OSGi one of the most mature and accapted Component standards has been established and proven to scale fantastically.

But a technology independant componet description standard as EAMD.ucp was still aways missing.

To fulfill the aspect of selfcontainment, a component.


## What is a Package

There are also more specialized Component types like e.g. Containers, Platforms.
A Package is also a Component. Even a Container Component. It contains Componnt Artifacts.
So it packages components to bigger components.
